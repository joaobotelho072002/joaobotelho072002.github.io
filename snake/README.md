# Snake game w/ Pygame

For developing this simple snake game I used [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) lib.

## Installation

Create and activate a new python virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv <venv_name>
source <venv_name>/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

How to run snake game after activating the virtual environment:

```bash
python3 snake.py
```
