# Snake game

For developing this simple snake game I used [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library.

[Snake Game code](https://github.com/joaobotelho072002/joaobotelho072002.github.io/tree/main/snake), the result looks like this:

## Installation

Create and activate a new python virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv <venv_name>
source <venv_name>/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

How to run snake game after activating the virtual environment:
